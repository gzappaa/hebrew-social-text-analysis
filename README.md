# Hebrew Social Text Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing Hebrew text collected from social media platforms in order to identify commonly used vocabulary and expressions.

The project was created primarily for personal and educational use, as a way to better understand how Hebrew is used in real, informal online contexts. By analyzing frequently used words and expressions, the goal is to support Hebrew language learning and improve familiarity with everyday vocabulary found on social networks.

In addition to the linguistic aspect, this project serves as practical hands-on experience with data analysis using Python, including working with real-world text data that is not in English.

## Dataset

The dataset was collected from Twitter on January 17th and consists of **manually selected tweets** from different topics to reflect a broad range of everyday Hebrew usage.

The data was intentionally collected manually to avoid reliance on external APIs and to ensure direct interaction with the raw text data.

## What This Project Does

- Loads raw Hebrew text data collected from social media
- Performs basic text preprocessing
- Identifies the most frequent words and simple expressions
- Outputs basic statistics to highlight commonly used vocabulary

## Why Hebrew Social Media Text?

Hebrew social media text presents unique challenges compared to English, such as informal language, slang, and inconsistent structure. Working with this type of data provides valuable experience in handling non-trivial text datasets and non-English language data.

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas
- Collections (Counter)

## Project Status

This project is currently under active development. Initial analysis focuses on word frequency, with potential future improvements including expression analysis and more advanced text processing.
